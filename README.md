# NUST Bank Chatbot: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## 1. Project Overview

The NUST Bank Chatbot is an intelligent conversational agent designed to provide instant and accurate support for NUST Bank customers. This project leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enhance customer service efficiency by automating responses to frequently asked questions and providing personalized information based on a dynamic knowledge base.

Traditional chatbots often encounter limitations in providing nuanced, up-to-date, or highly domain-specific information, which can lead to frustrating user experiences. This project addresses these challenges by integrating a RAG system that retrieves precise information from a curated document set before generating responses, ensuring higher accuracy and relevance in interactions.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Reliable Information Delivery**: Conversational banking context with high accuracy
- **Dynamic Knowledge Base**: Seamless integration of new documents without code modifications
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Fact-based responses grounded in bank-specific documentation

## 2. Features

### ü§ñ Intelligent Conversational Interface
- User-friendly chat window for natural language queries
- Support for various banking services including account inquiries, loan information, and general banking questions
- Real-time response generation

### üéØ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Accuracy
- Responses augmented with precise information from bank-specific knowledge base
- Significantly reduced likelihood of incorrect or fabricated information
- Improved factual accuracy and contextual relevance

### üìÅ Dynamic Knowledge Base via Document Upload
- Dedicated document upload functionality
- Support for policy updates, FAQs, and product brochures
- Automatic processing and indexing of new documents
- No code changes required for knowledge base updates

### üèóÔ∏è Scalable Architecture
- Modular design separating frontend from backend processing
- Independent development, deployment, and scaling capabilities
- Maintainable and extensible system architecture

## 3. Technical Architecture

The NUST Bank Chatbot employs a modular architecture that separates the user-facing frontend application from the backend RAG processing logic.

### System Components

| Component | Description | Primary Technologies |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Frontend Application** | User interface for chatbot interaction and document uploads | React.js, HTML, CSS |
| **Backend API** | Orchestrates RAG, handles user queries, and document processing | FastAPI, LangChain, Guardrails, Sentence Transformers |
| **Knowledge Base** | Stores vectorized document embeddings for efficient retrieval | Chroma DB, Document Loaders |
| **Large Language Model** | Generates conversational responses based on retrieved context | Phi3.5 Mini Instruct, Hugging Face/Unsloth |

### Architecture Overview

## 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

The RAG pipeline consists of five key stages:

### 1. Document Ingestion and Preprocessing
- Parse various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, JSON, etc)
- Extract and clean raw text content
- Split text into manageable chunks for optimal retrieval

### 2. Embedding Generation
- Transform text chunks into numerical vectors using pre-trained models
- Capture semantic meaning and contextual relationships
- Utilize Sentence Transformers or similar embedding models

### 3. Vector Store Indexing
- Store embeddings in specialized vector database (Chroma DB)
- Optimize for rapid similarity searches
- Enable semantic rather than keyword-based retrieval

### 4. Retrieval
- Convert user queries into embeddings
- Perform similarity search against indexed vector store
- Retrieve most semantically relevant document chunks

### 5. Generation
- Combine retrieved context with user query
- Generate coherent responses using Large Language Model (phi3.5-mini-instruct)
- Ensure factual accuracy through contextual grounding

## 5. Frontend Application

The frontend application serves as the primary interface for user interaction and document management.

### User Interface Features
- **Chatbot Interface**: Clean, intuitive chat window with conversation history
- **Document Upload Tab**: Dedicated section for uploading new documents
